# Fixing no ink levels being displayed in Epson Status Monitor


[Having recently installed a new Windows
PC]({filename}../2013/things-ive-learned-from-building-and.md)
I'd installed an Epson printer (SX515W). The printer itself was
connected via wifi and behaving apart from one thing. It wasn't
displaying the ink levels when checking them in Epson Status Monitor
(e.g. when sending a document to print). Instead, you just see the
message "Searchingâ€¦"[^1] and eventually get a
Communication Error.

In my experience, printer manufacturers do seem to
want to install a vast number of clunky utilities, setup helpers and
other cruft, so I'm always wary about just installing *everything* just
to get the thing running.

Anyway, [this

gave me the easy fix: **install Epson's Network
Utility**.
